The three laws can be stated as follows: First law (law of inertia): An object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force. An object in motion continues moving in a straight line at constant speed unless it encounters some sort of resistance or change in direction from outside sources like friction or air drag; this principle applies equally well whether we're talking about planets orbiting around stars",
